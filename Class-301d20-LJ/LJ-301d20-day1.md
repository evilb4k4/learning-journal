# Learning Journal for 301d20 Day 1
First day of 301 one we went over what assignment we will be having everyday. We also had our first pair programming assignment it was the last problem was a bit of a challenge. Pair programming will be an everyday project which will be a good real world practice.
I think for this class time management will be key to not falling behind. I also will need to get a code wars account and join the code fellows clan which sound cool. Overall I think this class is going to be challenging and fun.
