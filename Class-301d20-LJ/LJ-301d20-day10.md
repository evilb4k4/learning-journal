# Learning Journal for 301d20 Day 10
Today was day 10 of 301 we already half way thru this course man time flying by. Today was one if not the hardest lab we had to do at least for me. For me the TODO's were not clear what need to be done, we did have to do a lot of brainstorming in order to get the answers but it was challenging and I fell accomplished when we got the answers. We had a weird linter error that took us an hour to figure out but we tried everything to fix but we could not figure it out, Sam tried to replicated the error and he couldn't figure it out as well. We ended up getting help from another team for help their code look exactly like ours and but they did get the error, we copy there code in too our and that fixed the error but I still don't know why the error keep happening or how was it fixed I guess it was the coding magic.
