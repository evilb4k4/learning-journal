# Learning Journal for 301d20 Day 11
Today we did turn are blog to a single page application using .page() and some iife. The lab was simple to solve it only took 1 1\2 hour. I used the rest of the time trying to catch up on my late assignments I've had a rough couple of week at home and it been affecting my school work but I know  I'll be able to catch up this upcoming 3 day weekend.
