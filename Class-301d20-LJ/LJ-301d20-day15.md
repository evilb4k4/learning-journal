# Learning Journal for 301d20 Day 15
Today was the last day of week 3 we started prepping for project week we did a wireframe and our outline we even bought a domain name for the project.
I feel good about this project, we a have a simple project with a good outline of what need to happen and we work well as a team. I been having a hard time keep up with the portfolio I'm hoping I will be able to catch up this weekend.
