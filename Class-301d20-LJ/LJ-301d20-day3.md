# Learning Journal for 301d20 Day 3
Today we went over event and how to use them with jQuery with .on() method. It was a challenging Lab today with the last 2 TODO game me the most trouble had to read Docs. So far the class is going well but there is a lot material to manage, I'm having trouble keeping up but it is a fun challenge. jQuery does make JavaScript a little simpler but I am having bit of trouble reading the code. It is useful doing lab as a group we help each other understand the code and how to use it.
