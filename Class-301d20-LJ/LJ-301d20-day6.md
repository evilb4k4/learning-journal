# Learning Journal for 301d20 Day 6/7
I was out sick on day 6 for class so I'm writing what happen for day 7 of class. We went over setting up server.js file for node. It cool how we create are server and how to set up the dependencies is pretty simple but not at first it took me till the lab to figure out how it work properly.

notes code used
1. npm install: code use to install node_ module
2. npm i --save (dependencies): save new dependencies
