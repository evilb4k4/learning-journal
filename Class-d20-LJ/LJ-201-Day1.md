# LJ-201-DAY 1
Today was the first day of class at code fellows. There was alot of information
to take in, One thing i found out is that this maybe one of the most challenging
class I've ever take in term of how fast the class will be moving along but I think
I'm up to the challenge.

Thing we learn in class today was the html structure and java alerts & prompts.
We turn in an assignment today using html and javascript it was simple yet complicated
I may have over thought it. But i think i got the hang of it. We learn GitHub commands, GitHub is still very new to me
I will need to study up on the git command.

# List of thing i need to work on for future assignment
1. Learn GitHub commands.
2. My typing
3. Need to ask more question as they come up so im not as lost when it lab time.
