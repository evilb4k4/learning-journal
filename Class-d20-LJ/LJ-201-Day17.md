# LJ 201 day 17
Worked on project today we got a lot done. I had a tough time with a css issue getting the form to sit right.
Now all the home page will need is JavaScript to hold the email and name and display the name on the thank you page.

# Tomorrow goals
1. complete the JavaScript for the homepage
2. add finish touch to the home page
