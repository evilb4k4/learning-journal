#LJ-201-day 8
The last 2 day we been working on the salmon cookies labs. we created a table in html using javascript
and then we created a form in the html and have it add the table we created. Creating form was pretty straight forward
using the <feildset> tag i used the book example to help build the form. where i got lost for a bit was how to connect to the javascript
table to create a new row. Doing the CSS is also a bit tricky as well getting to look good is what i mean by tricky.



#Issue I ran into
getting the table to print was the a difficult for me and connecting the form with table to get a new row to print out.
I need to try more css styling practice
