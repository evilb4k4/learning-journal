# LJ d21 Day 6 April 12 2017
I was out sick on monday the day this journal entry was do, so I'm writing about day 6 & 7. I day six the class started working on the salmon project
with writing it in literal notation. I got my list to post on the page but i'm still having trouble with the css styling the page. On day 7 we stared building are project into a table. Overall it went better this time around i understand code better this time around. I trying to ask more question this time around to make sure i understand my code and i don't put code in my program if i don't understand what it does.
