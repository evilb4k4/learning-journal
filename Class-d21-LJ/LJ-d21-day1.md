# LJ d21 Day 1 and 2
Today is a 2 day learning journal for april 3 and 4.  
Today we started the About me project and the yes and no question, so far I'm feeling good about how im coding. I will try and push myself to do better work that the past i like to get better on my css I got a codepen account today i will be trying to do more style pages but I'm still having issue with talking about myself and adding content about myself that make sense and not to just add content to fill the page.
