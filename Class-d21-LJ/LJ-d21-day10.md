Today we reviewed all of the salmon cookie project, I did learn how to do do the hour header line for the table with out using and array somthing I had not seen before it made the code look clean. We also did the chocolate pizza project the CSS challenge, I have do it before so I thoguth that it would be easy to do do this time but i still struggled with the css. I still struggling with floating images and centering on the page. I had to leave at 430 to catch my bus so i turn in the project late because i didn't get home till 7 pm and my internet at home was down till like 830pm.
