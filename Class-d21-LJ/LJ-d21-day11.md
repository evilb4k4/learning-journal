# LJ d21 day 11
We started bus mall project today. I been kinda nerves about this project because I done it before and it still challenge me.
I got stuck on getting the picture to print but when i got it i felt really dumb because i should have know how to do it with out help but yesterday was not a good day for me. My plan was to get the list to print and everything but i only got the picture to print and be clickable.
