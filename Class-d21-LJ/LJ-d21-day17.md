# LJ d21 201 day 17
Today was day 2 on working on the project we rebuild the form in javascript, we also ran into some issue with merge conflict but overall we got everything almost working. Tomorrow will need to finish the logic on the form and start css the page. We weren't able to deploy are project to gh-pages so tomorrow is going to be priority.
