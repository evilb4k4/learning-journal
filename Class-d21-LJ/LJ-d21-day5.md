We review the guessing game question 1, 6, 7. I did get a better idea on how to approach the assignments it really did help out with today lab the function problems.
 Instead of writing a lot of code right away take it on line at a time console log more. I think because I had done the lab before this time I did not struggle with
 this assignment like before and I feel like I understand my code better.
