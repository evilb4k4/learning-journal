#LJ-day 10 Friday 17 2017
We finish the salmon cookie page. The friday project showed me how much you can get done in a short time.
It help alot to have a picture of what you need to build. After week 2 I feel a little better about how the classes are going
and not feeling so stessed about everything. I still have to work on time management and learn how to design my page ahead of time
so i dont waste time on redoing it over and over.
