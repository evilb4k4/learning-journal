# meet up
I went to a JS Hack Meet up for local Javascript community it was intresting see ing some of the project they were working
on some were for fun other were work and school. There were alot of knowledgeable people at the meet up. This meet up was casual
i got to talk developer and asked them some advise on some of the issue i been having and tips for the future.
