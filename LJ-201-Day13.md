#LJ 201 day 13
I was absent from class on this day. Today leacture was on local storage for are table.
you need storage to keep data for your chart thru many user using it. also we learned about css styling
with animation it very intresting how you can change the whole look of your page with a little css.
Over all i feel more confident with my coding skills after this week project.
