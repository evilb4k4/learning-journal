# LJ 201 Day 15
Today class was preview 301 class and work on merge conflicts in prep for project week and we got in are group for project week to discuss wire frame.
As for the merge confilcts i feel that as long as we have a set rule that no one works on the master branch and we alway have at least 2 people check
it before we merge it to the master branch will avoid most if not all the merge conflicts but if we do get one will be able to resolve it as a team.

# project thoughts
i think we got a goo starting plan as long we dont let the project get too big i think will be in good shape. I feel more cofident in my coding that
we can do a good job on this project.
