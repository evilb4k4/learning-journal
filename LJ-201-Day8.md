#LJ-201-day 8
The last 2 day we been working on the salmon cookies labs. we created a table in html using javascript
and then we created a form in the html and have it add the table we created.

#Issue I ran into
getting the table to print was the a difficult for me and connecting the form with table to get a new row to print out.
